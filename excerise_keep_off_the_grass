How do you decide how to spend your resources?


How do you decide in which directions your bots move.


Are there situations where your bots behaved in a suboptimal way? Why does
this happen? (At any point of the challenge)


What are some heuristics to improve your bots performance?
If you implemented them: how did it work?
If you did not implement them, argue why you think they should work.

What did you learn from observing other peoples bots?
